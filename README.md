# pattern_recognition

lab 1 investigates three areas: calculating orthogononal transformations, creating decision boundaries, and assigning classification errors. 

Class A and B and grouped as case 1 and Class C,D, and E are grouped as case 2. Synthetic data are generated as bivariate normally distributed and a transformation has been applied. The unit standard deviation for each class is also generated. Five classfiers are used: MED, GED, MAP,NN,and KNN and compared. The error analysis for each classifier is conducted by calculating the experimental error rate and generating a confusion matrix.
