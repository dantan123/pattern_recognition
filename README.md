lab 1 investigates three areas: calculating orthogononal transformations, creating decision boundaries, and assigning classification errors. Class A and B are grouped as case 1 and Class C,D, and E are grouped as case 2. Synthetic data are generated as bivariate normally distributed. Five distance classfiers are used: MED, GED, MAP,NN,and KNN.  The error analysis for each classifier is conducted by calculating the experimental error rate and generating a confusion matrix.

lab 2 involves model estimation and learning through both parametric and nonparametric methods using MLE and parzen windows (kernal density estimation).The following links describe the methodologies.
